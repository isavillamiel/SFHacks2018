I texted Sarah last night asking if she wanted to have lunch with me today, just the two of us, and she said sure. I told her that just because I&rsquo;m hanging out with Jane, it doesn&rsquo;t change anything about our friendship. After all, we&rsquo;ve been friends since first grade! She said that she knows that, but she just felt like the third wheel because she doesn&rsquo;t think that Jane likes her and because Jane and I have a lot of classes together. I told her not to worry about what Jane thought and that I&rsquo;d talk to her about it. Sarah felt a lot better, and after we both cried a little, we spent the rest of lunch catching up on the latest gossip, which I missed! &nbsp;</span></p>

She said that it&rsquo;s not that she doesn&rsquo;t like Sarah; she just thinks that she gets too worked up about things&nbsp;sometime, like her breakup with Nick. I explained why Sarah was so upset about it and how Nick had cheated on her, which Jane didn&rsquo;t know, and she felt bad for saying mean things about Sarah. I think Jane&rsquo;s really cool, but I wish she wouldn&rsquo;t assume things about people. I&rsquo;m worried she was saying mean things about Sarah to our other friends when she didn&rsquo;t know the truth. She sometimes likes to spread rumors even when she doesn&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re true. &nbsp;</span></p>

I&rsquo;m not sure how well that worked, because even though Jane was trying really hard to be nice to Sarah, I could tell that Sarah was being really fake with Jane. When I texted Sarah later, she said everything was fine, but I know her well enough to know that&rsquo;s not completely true.</span></p>
