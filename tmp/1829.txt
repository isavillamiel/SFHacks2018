But what really made me mad was the note that Sarah slipped into my locker during passing period. She said she was sad that I&rsquo;ve been hanging out with Jane more lately and thinks that I don&rsquo;t want to be her friend anymore. I can&rsquo;t believe she thinks that, especially after talking with her on the phone for hours and hours last month while she was going through her breakup with Nick! Just because I&rsquo;ve been hanging out with Jane a little more than usual doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not her friend anymore. She completely blew me off at lunch, and when I told Jane, she thought that Sarah was being a &ldquo;drama queen.&rdquo;</span></p>

My parents are getting on my case about doing more extracurricular activities, I have a huge paper due for AP English soon, and I can&rsquo;t understand a thing in advanced Spanish! The last thing I need is for my best friend to think I hate her and barely text me back anymore. &nbsp;</span></p>
