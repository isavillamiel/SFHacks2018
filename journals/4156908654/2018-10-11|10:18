Yesterday, she barely spoke to me, and anything she did say was a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer. &nbsp;I tried so hard to get her to cheer up, but of course she just kept saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Uggh! I wish she would just be honest with me! I&rsquo;m always honest with her! It&rsquo;s not fair!</span></p>

I hate being in the middle of all of this. What am I supposed to do? Sarah&rsquo;s been my friend since forever, and Jane is my new friend, and I don&rsquo;t want to hurt anyone&rsquo;s feelings! But I think that Jane is right about Sarah. I think Sarah sometimes gets too dramatic about things. She&rsquo;s being kind of a brat about all of this, but I don&rsquo;t want to tell her that to her face, she&rsquo;d never forgive me.</span></p>
